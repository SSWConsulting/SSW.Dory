### About
By identifying unchecked SharePoint pages and long-pending GitHub Pull Requests, Dory consolidates these potential blockers into a dedicated SharePoint list.   

And the best part? You don't have to worry about manual clean-up.   

Each day, SSW.Dory refreshes this list, ensuring that it always presents the most current data, while outdated entries are automatically removed. 

With Dory, you're always a step ahead, working with the freshest information.
